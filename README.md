## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   SASS/SCSS
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Media queries

### What I learned

In this work, I improved my skills with the grid, practiced creating and changing it depending on the width of the screen, worked with positioning and, of course, with media queries.

### Continued development

I also want to learn how to make up grid layouts faster, use templates and then start making up pages with js functionality
